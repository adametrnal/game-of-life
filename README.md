A Game of Life Simulation Using Backbone.js

I was looking for a project to use to help familiarize myself with Backbone and Conway's Game of Life seemed
like a good choice since cells seemed to fit nicely with the model/collection way of doing thigns.

Here's a bit of background about the game:
The Game of Life is a classic example of cellular automaton that was [invented by John Conway in 1970.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). The game shows that incredibly complex phenomena can be observed from only a few simple rules: 

1. Any living cell with fewer than two neighbors will die from lonelyness
2. Any living cell with more than three neighbors will die from overpopulation.
3. Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors will be born.
4.  Any living cell with two or three neighbors will live on.

The code is currently running [here](http://adam-brill.com/sites/game_of_life/)
